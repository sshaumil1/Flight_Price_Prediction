# Flight_Price_Prediction
**The objective of the case study is to analyse the flight booking dataset obtained from “Ease My Trip” website and to conduct various statistical hypothesis tests in order to get meaningful information from it. 'Easemytrip' is an internet platform for booking flight tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers. Overall, I have to build a model that can precisely predict the ticket price.**

#### Brain Storming
By getting problem of the client, i have some questions in my mind, which are follow

**a) Does price vary with Airlines?**

**b) How is the price affected when tickets are bought in just 1 or 2 days before departure?**

**c) Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?**

**d) How the price changes with change in Source and Destination?**

**e) How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?, etc**

#### Data is seperated in to two parts:
one for **economy class** tickets and another for **business class** tickets.

**A total of 300261 distinct flight booking options are available. And these are for 50 days, from February 11th to March 31st, 2022.**
